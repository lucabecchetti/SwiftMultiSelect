During develop of my apps, i usually needed to select more than one element from a tableview, but i don't like the native ios integration, i think is not graphically clear, so, i created this library. Choose SwiftMultiSelect for your next project, I'll be happy to give you a little help!

## Installation with CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, which automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries like SwiftMultiSelect in your projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

To integrate SwiftMultiSelect into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '8.0'

target 'TargetName' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'SwiftMultiSelect'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## How to use

First of all import library in your project

```swift
import SwiftMultiSelect
```

The library can show elements from PhoneBook or from a custom list, this is defined by config variable "dataSourceType", it can assume a value from SwiftMultiSelectSourceType "enum", by default is "phone".  

```swift

/// (default) use a contact from PhoneBook, (need a string in info.plist)
SwiftMultiSelect.dataSourceType = .phone

/// (default) use items from custom list, (need to implement a datasource protocol)
SwiftMultiSelect.dataSourceType = .custom

```

### Use PhoneBook contacts

Note: If you want to use a default value "phone", insert this string in yout info.plist file:

```xml
<dict>
	
  .....
  
	<key>NSContactsUsageDescription</key>
	<string>This app needs access to contacts.</string>
  
  ....
  
</dict>
```

The basic code to show a simple multi selection is: 

```swift
//Implement delegate in your UIViewController
class ViewController: UIViewController,SwiftMultiSelectDelegate {
  
  override func viewDidLoad() {
        
        super.viewDidLoad()
      
        //Register delegate
        SwiftMultiSelect.delegate       = self
    
  }

  //MARK: - SwiftMultiSelectDelegate
    
    //User write something in searchbar
    func userDidSearch(searchString: String) {
        
        print("User is looking for: \(searchString)")
        
    }

    //User did unselect an item
    func swiftMultiSelect(didUnselectItem item: SwiftMultiSelectItem) {
        print("row: \(item.title) has been deselected!")
    }

    //User did select an item
    func swiftMultiSelect(didSelectItem item: SwiftMultiSelectItem) {
        print("item: \(item.title) has been selected!")
    }

    //User did close controller with no selection
    func didCloseSwiftMultiSelect() {
        print("no items selected")
    }

    //User completed selection
    func swiftMultiSelect(didSelectItems items: [SwiftMultiSelectItem]) {

        print("you have been selected: \(items.count) items!")
        
        for item in items{
            print(item.string)
        }
        
    }
  
}
```

### Show controller

Now, somewhere in the code, use:

```swift
   SwiftMultiSelect.Show(to: self)
```

### Use a custom list of SwiftMultiSelectItem

#### Create SwiftMultiSelectItem object

This library can show only an array of "SwiftMultiSelectItem" object, you can pass many parameters to his initializer:

```swift
let item = SwiftMultiSelectItem(
        //An incremental unique identifier
        row         : 0,
        //Title for first line
        title       : "Item 0",
        //Description line
        description : "i am description 0",
        //Image asset, shown if no imageURL has been set
        image       : UIImage(),
        //Url of remote image
        imageURL    : "",
        //Custom color, if not present a random color will be assigned
        color       : UIColor.gray
        //Your custom data, Any object
        userInfo    : ["id" : 10]
)
```

#### Implement dataSource protocol
To pass you list of SwiftMultiSelectItem, from the previuos example, you have to implement SwiftMultiSelectDataSource

```swift
//Implement delegate in your UIViewController
class ViewController: UIViewController,SwiftMultiSelectDelegate,SwiftMultiSelectDataSource {

  //Declare list to use
  var items:[SwiftMultiSelectItem] = [SwiftMultiSelectItem]()
  
  override func viewDidLoad() {
        
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.

        //Generate items
        createItems()
       
        //Se the correct data source type
        SwiftMultiSelect.dataSourceType = .custom
        
        //Register delegate
        SwiftMultiSelect.dataSource     = self
        SwiftMultiSelect.delegate       = self
        
    }
    
    //MARK: - SwiftMultiSelectDataSource
    
    func numberOfItemsInSwiftMultiSelect() -> Int {
        return items.count
    }
    
    func swiftMultiSelect(itemAtRow row: Int) -> SwiftMultiSelectItem {
        return items[row]
    }
    

}
```

### Interact with controller

To interact with controller you have a Delegate class and DataSource Class:

```swift
/// A data source
public protocol SwiftMultiSelectDataSource{
    
    /// Ask datasource for current item in row
    func swiftMultiSelect(itemAtRow row:Int) -> SwiftMultiSelectItem
    
    /// Asks datasource for the number of items
    func numberOfItemsInSwiftMultiSelect() -> Int
    
}

/// A delegate
public protocol SwiftMultiSelectDelegate{
    
    /// Called when user did end selection
    func swiftMultiSelect(didSelectItems items:[SwiftMultiSelectItem])
    
    /// Called when user has been selected an item
    func swiftMultiSelect(didSelectItem item:SwiftMultiSelectItem)
    
    /// Called when user has been unselected an item
    func swiftMultiSelect(didUnselectItem item:SwiftMultiSelectItem)
    
    /// Called when user has been closed with no selection
    func didCloseSwiftMultiSelect()
    
    /// Called when user did write in searchbar
    func userDidSearch(searchString:String)   
}
```

### Customization

SwiftMultiSelect is fully customizable, to configure it you have to modify that Config struct:

```swift
/// Public struct for configuration and customizations
public struct Config {

    /// Background of main view
    public static var mainBackground        :   UIColor    = UIColor.white
    /// View's title
    public static var viewTitle             :   String     = "Swift Multiple Select"
    /// Title for done button
    public static var doneString            :   String     = "Done"
    //Placeholder image during lazy load
    public static var placeholder_image     :   UIImage     = SwiftMultiSelect.image(named: "user_blank")!
    /// Array of colors to use in initials
    public static var colorArray        :   [UIColor]  = [
        ThemeColors.amethystColor,
        ThemeColors.asbestosColor,
        ThemeColors.emeraldColor,
        ThemeColors.peterRiverColor,
        ThemeColors.pomegranateColor,
        ThemeColors.pumpkinColor,
        ThemeColors.sunflowerColor
    ]
    
    /// Define the style of tableview
    public struct tableStyle{
        
        //Background color of tableview
        public static var backgroundColor       :   UIColor = .white
        //Height of single row
        public static var tableRowHeight        :   Double  = 70.0
        //Margin between imageavatar and cell borders
        public static var avatarMargin          :   Double  = 7.0
        //Color for title label, first line
        public static var title_color           :   UIColor = .black
        //Font for title label
        public static var title_font            :   UIFont  = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 16.0)
        //Color for description label, first line
        public static var description_color     :   UIColor = .gray
        //Font for description label
        public static var description_font      :   UIFont  = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 13.0)
        //Color for initials label
        public static var initials_color        :   UIColor = .white
        //Font for initials label
        public static var initials_font         :   UIFont  = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18.0)

    }
    
    /// Define the style of scrollview
    public struct selectorStyle{
        
        //Image asset for remove button
        public static var removeButtonImage     :   UIImage = SwiftMultiSelect.image(named: "remove")!
        //The height of selectorview, all subviews will be resized
        public static var selectionHeight       :   Double  = 90.0
        //Scale factor for size of imageavatar based on cell size
        public static var avatarScale           :   Double  = 1.7
        //Color for separator line between scrollview and tableview
        public static var separatorColor        :   UIColor = UIColor.lightGray
        //Height for separator line between scrollview and tableview
        public static var separatorHeight       :   Double  = 0.7
        //Background color of uiscrollview
        public static var backgroundColor       :   UIColor = .white
        //Color for title label
        public static var title_color           :   UIColor = .black
         //Font for title label
        public static var title_font            :   UIFont  = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 11.0)
        //Color for initials label
        public static var initials_color        :   UIColor = .white
        //Font for initials label
        public static var initials_font         :   UIFont  = UIFont.systemFont(ofSize: 18.0)
        //Background color of collectionviewcell
        public static var backgroundCellColor   :   UIColor = .clear
        
    }

}
```

You can set variables before show a controller, for example in ViewDidLoad:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
        
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        // Do any additional setup
        Config.doneString = "Ok"
        
        SwiftMultiSelect.dataSource     = self
        SwiftMultiSelect.delegate       = self
        
}
```
